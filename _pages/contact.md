Some of the major projects I've worked on are listed below. They include Course projects, competition reports, and other technical works. A complete report may be found by clicking on the title.


<br>
<b> [Configuring Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) for Wireless Communications](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1epMAsOWmBjENBxGsDEXXRXAPf8Hj1kCx/view?usp=sharing)</b> <br>
Our approach to the problem statement at IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2021. We estimated the Channel model using Least Squares and generalized a Dictionary Learning based scheme to the IRS system model for frequency selective channels and optimized IRS configuration using Projected Gradient Ascent. 


<br>
<b> [Content Caching in Matern Cluster Process](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I6bcr7lUCh90gSUwmJfvOv_Z-6WTDCGs/view?usp=sharing)</b> <br> 
Derived the expressions for Cache Aided Throughput in Matern Clustered Process (MCPs), using the framework of stochastic geometry, when both the Base Stationâ€™s (BS) and users cache the files.


<br>
<b> [Newton's Sketch for Non-separable functions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iXiIGPKdvZMTA9yOEWCUqgXgFHsWlZxF/view?usp=sharing), [[Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nV1G5SRBMXHLRuQvZv4ORN23DQE3XOMX/view?usp=sharing)]</b> <br>
Analyzed feasibility and un-biasedness of a new sketching technique for Newton's method which does not require computing square-root of the Hessian matrix and hence can be used for optimizing non-seperable functions. Showed Local Linear-Quadratic convergence of Newton's method under this sketching scheme. Developed a global convergence analysis of sketched Newton for self-concordant functions.

<br>
<b> [On the Capacity of Computation Broadcast](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KH4IuVcsP0hmnblrF67g_TzoJ3RuO3ww/view?usp=sharing)</b> <br> 
Read about the problem of Computation Broadcast and its relation to Index Coding and some special cases of Computation Broadcast problem.


<br>
<br>
<b> [Fundamentals of Index Coding](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YENsG2ihf_nyE3Si8s2hFzFWqD0sGBsO/view?usp=sharing)</b> <br> 
Read a survey paper on `Fundamentals of Index Coding' and explored related papers. Gave a talk on the same, explaining the duality between Index Coding problem and Locally Recoverable Distributed Storage Problem.

<br>
<br>
<b> [BAJA SAE, IIT-K Motorsports](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lSi67uNwJpiNEicml4HWsMonf22yhcEM)</b> <br> 
Implemented and designed multi-link suspension for an All-Terrain vehicle. Used MATLAB for development of suspension kinematics using numerical optimization techniques.
