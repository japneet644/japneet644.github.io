Here are some of the major projects that I have undertaken. Some of them are course projects, competitions reports or other technical projects. 
Click on the title for a detailed report.

<br>
<b> [Compressive Sensing Matrix Design](https://ameyanjarlekar.github.io/files/BTP1.pdf)</b> <br>
Video Compression algorithm specifically for Daikin video-database. Uses a Hitomi Camera architecture inspired compressed sensing algorithm.

<br>
<b> [Video Compression for efficient Remote Support video storage and retrieval](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s6hPTey_Io6pHKXVyL2HjT6fy4xf-CgNCyTM-haO-80/edit?usp=sharing)</b> <br>
 Designed sensing matrices by minimizing weighted (determined from training data). Also, proposed an approach to design weights to handle rotation and scaling of images.
 
<br>
<b>[Blind Compressed Sensing](https://ameyanjarlekar.github.io/files/BCS.pdf)</b> <br> 
 Reviewed various theoretical results of Blind Compressed Sensing and implemented the corresponding algorithm for joint estimation of dictionaryand images. Detailed mathematical analysis can be found <b>[here](https://ameyanjarlekar.github.io/files/Mathematical_analysis.pdf)</b>.
 
<br>
<b>[Use of Residuals for Image Denoising](http://ameyanjarlekar.github.io/files/residuals.pdf)</b> <br> 
 Denoising algorithm using the residual image. Also, studied and implemented metrics for quality of image denoising without the use of the reference image.
 
 <br>
<b>[Target Parameter Estimation from Compressive Measurements](http://ameyanjarlekar.github.io/files/Doppler-Microdoppler.pdf)</b> <br> 
 Parameter estimation of rotating targets through Doppler and Micro-Doppler estimation of corresponding radar signals from their compressive measurements.

<br>
<b>[Supervised Detection of Tennis Ball from Camera Stream](https://github.com/ameyanjarlekar/MRT)</b> <br> 
Ball detection task required in the autonomous operations of the mars rover. This was done as a part of the IITB Mars Rover Team for the University Rover Challenge. 

<br>
<b>[Image Reconstruction for Parallel MRI](https://github.com/ameyanjarlekar/Grappa-algorithm-for-Parallel-MRI)</b> <br> 
Modified version of GRAPPA algorithm on Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA Board for image reconstruction during Parallel MRI used in the indigenous MRI machine being developed at IIT Bombay

<br>
<b>[Distortion Correction for Modulation Recognition](http://ameyanjarlekar.github.io/files/signal_distort.pdf)</b> <br> 
Deployed a CNN model on the "RML2018.10a" dataset for the frequency estimation of various signals and analyzed its performance over various Signal to Noise (SNR) ratio

<br>
<b>[Microprocessor design](http://ameyanjarlekar.github.io/publications/proc.md)</b> <br> 
Designed a RISC microprocessor using VHDL

<br>
<b>[Text Categorization](http://ameyanjarlekar.github.io/files/text_categ.pdf)</b> <br> 
Classifying various articles from the 20Newsgroups dataset into 20 different categories.
