I am a fifth year dual degree student (B.tech-M.tech) in Electrical Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](www.iitk.ac.in) working under the guidance of [Prof. Adrish Banerjee](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~adrish/) and [Prof. Ketan Rajawat](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/). 

Broadly, I'm interested in employing mathematical techniques to address real-world bottlenecks in realistic systems and to characterize the fundamental limits of various models in Wireless communications, Distributed computing, Large-scale optimization etc. My research interests include Information and Coding Theory, Convex Optimization, Wireless Communications, Machine Learning.

During my time at IITK, I have been involved in various research project in Coding theory, Convex optimization, Machine learning, Performance analyis using Stochastic Geometry etc.

I spent my free time listening to classical music.
