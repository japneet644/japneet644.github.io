I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Purdue University](purdue.edu), advised by [Prof. Anuran Makur](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/amakur/index.html). Earlier I did my Bachelor's and Master's (B.tech-M.tech) in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](www.iitk.ac.in) working under the guidance of [Prof. Adrish Banerjee](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~adrish/) and [Prof. Ketan Rajawat](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/). 

I'm interested in employing mathematical techniques to address real-world bottlenecks in realistic system models and to characterize the fundamental limits of various processes in Large-scale optimization, Distributed computing etc. My research interests include Ranking and Preference Learning, Information and Coding Theory, Machine Learning, Large Scale Optimization.
