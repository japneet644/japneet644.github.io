I am a fifth year dual degree student (B.tech-M.tech) in Electrical Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](www.iitk.ac.in). I am interested in Coding theory.
During my time at IITK, I have been involvedd in various research project in Coding theory, Convex optimization, Machine learning, Performance analyis using Stochastic Geometry etc. My master thesis focuses on developing algorithms for Topological Interferences Management and doing performance analysis in realistic system models.
