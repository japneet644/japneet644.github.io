I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by [Prof. Anuran Makur](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/amakur/index.html). Currently, I am working on problems in Ranking and preference learning and investigating the properties of contraction coefficients in Information theory.  

My research interests include Machine Learning and Statistics, Information and Coding Theory, Large Scale Optimization. Broadly, I'm interested in employing mathematical techniques to address real-world bottlenecks in realistic system models and to characterize the fundamental limits of various processes in Large-scale optimization, Distributed computing etc. 

Earlier I did my Bachelor's and Master's (B.tech-M.tech) in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](www.iitk.ac.in) working under the guidance of [Prof. Adrish Banerjee](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~adrish/) and [Prof. Ketan Rajawat](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/).
