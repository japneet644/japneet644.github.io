I am a fifth year dual degree student (B.tech-M.tech) in Electrical Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](www.iitk.ac.in) working under the guidance of Prof. Adrish Banerjee and Prof. Ketan Rajawat. My research interests include Information and Coding Theory, Convex Optimization, Wireless Communications, Machine Learning. Broadly, I'm interested in employing mathematical techniques to address real-world bottlenecks in realistic systems and to characterize the fundamental limits of various models in Wireless communications, Distributed computing, Large-scale optimization etc.

During my time at IITK, I have been involved in various research project in Coding theory, Convex optimization, Machine learning, Performance analyis using Stochastic Geometry etc.

I spent my free time listening to classical music.
