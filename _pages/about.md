I am a 4th year PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by [Prof. Anuran Makur](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/amakur/index.html). My research focuses on problems in Ranking and preference learning and investigating the properties of contraction coefficients in Information theory.  

My research interests span Machine Learning and Statistics, Information and Coding Theory, Large Scale Optimization. Broadly, I work on developing mathematically grounded methods for extracting signal from noisy, high-dimensional data, with an emphasis on fundamental limits and scalable algorithms. In the summer of 2025, I interned at Amazon (Sunnyvale), where I worked on adaptive video language models. 

Earlier, I did my Bachelor's and Master's (B.tech-M.tech) in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](www.iitk.ac.in) working under the guidance of [Prof. Adrish Banerjee](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~adrish/) and [Prof. Ketan Rajawat](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/). 


I am currently **on the job market** for full-time research roles and expect to **graduate in January 2026**.
