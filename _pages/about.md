I am a fifth year dual degree student (B.tech-M.tech) in Electrical Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](www.iitk.ac.in) working under the guidance of Prof. Adrish Banerjee and Prof. Ketan Rajawat. My master thesis focuses on developing algorithms for Topological Interferences Management and doing performance analysis in realistic system models. 

During my time at IITK, I have been involvedd in various research project in Coding theory, Convex optimization, Machine learning, Performance analyis using Stochastic Geometry etc.

I am interested in Coding theory and Optimization to adress real-world bottlenecks in realistic system models and to chararcterize fundamental limits of various models in Wireless communications, Distributed Computing, Large Scale Optimization etc.

I spent my free time listening to classical music.
